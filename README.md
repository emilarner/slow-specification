# slow-specification
The Slow Programming Language specification. Useful for convenience.


This specification is to be used for explaining how the basic, fundamental operations of the language work, as well as the more extensive--yet incomplete--standard library that the *Slow Programming Language* wishes to implement and support.

It shall be noted that the entire standard library of the *Slow Programming Language* is **NOT** included within this document--only aspects which are considered to be core are.
